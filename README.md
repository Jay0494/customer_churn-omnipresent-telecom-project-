### Analysis of Churn Insights:

1. **Churn vs Retention Rate**:
   - **Churn Rate**: 26.54%
   - **Retention Rate**: 73.46%

   **Insight**: The company retains a healthy percentage of its customers, but a churn rate of over 25% is significant. This indicates that more than a quarter of customers are leaving, which could have a substantial impact on long-term revenue and profitability.

2. **Revenue Impact**:
   - **Total Revenue**: $16,056,168.7
   - **Revenue Lost from Churned Customers**: $2,862,926.90

   **Insight**: The company loses about 17.8% of its potential revenue due to churn. This shows a direct relationship between customer attrition and financial performance. Addressing churn effectively could reclaim a significant portion of this lost revenue.

3. **Tickets Analysis**:
   - **Admin Tickets**: 3,632
   - **Tech Tickets**: 2,955

   **Insight**: More admin tickets are raised compared to tech tickets, indicating potential customer dissatisfaction or confusion with administrative aspects (billing, account management) over technical issues. Streamlining administrative processes might reduce friction points for customers.

4. **Revenue by Contract Type**:
   - **Two-Year Contracts**: $6,283,253.7
   - **One-Year Contracts**: $4,467,053.5
   - **Month-to-Month**: $5,305,861.5

   **Insight**: The highest revenue comes from two-year contracts, followed by month-to-month, then one-year. This indicates that longer-term contracts may be more lucrative and stable, but month-to-month offers flexibility. The company may benefit from offering incentives for longer-term commitments to drive up revenue stability.

5. **Churn Rate by Contract Type**:
   - **Month-to-Month**: 42.71%
   - **One-Year**: 11.27%
   - **Two-Year**: 2.83%

   **Insight**: The churn rate for month-to-month contracts is very high, whereas longer-term contracts (one- and two-year) have much lower churn rates. This suggests that encouraging customers to commit to longer contracts could significantly reduce churn.

6. **Churn Rate by Payment Method**:
   - **Electronic Check**: 45.29%
   - **Mailed Check**: 19.11%
   - **Bank Transfer**: 16.71%
   - **Credit Card**: 15.24%

   **Insight**: Customers who use electronic checks have the highest churn rate, while those paying via credit card or bank transfer are less likely to churn. This may suggest a correlation between payment method convenience and customer loyalty. Encouraging customers to switch to more stable and automatic payment methods could reduce churn.

7. **Churn Rate by Internet Service Type**:
   - **Fiber Optic**: 41.89%
   - **DSL**: 18.96%
   - **No Internet Service**: 7.40%

   **Insight**: Fiber optic customers have the highest churn rate despite it being a faster, more reliable service. This suggests that other factors like price, customer service, or competition might be affecting these customers' decisions to leave.

8. **Churn by Multiple Lines**:
   - **Multiple Lines**: 28.61%
   - **No Multiple Lines**: 25.04%
   - **No Phone Service**: 24.93%

   **Insight**: Customers with multiple lines tend to have a slightly higher churn rate. This could indicate that managing multiple services adds complexity and frustration, leading to higher churn.

9. **Dependents and Churn**:
   - **Customers without dependents**: 66.94%
   - **Customers with dependents**: 33.06%

   **Insight**: A larger proportion of churned customers do not have dependents, suggesting that families may be more stable and less likely to churn. This could inform targeted retention strategies focused on households without dependents.

### Recommendations:

1. **Promote Long-Term Contracts**: 
   Encourage customers to switch to one- or two-year contracts by offering discounts, perks, or loyalty rewards. This could significantly reduce churn.

2. **Targeted Payment Method Interventions**: 
   Customers using electronic checks have a notably higher churn rate. Offering incentives (e.g., discounts) to switch to automatic payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers could improve retention.

3. **Improve Customer Experience with Fiber Optic Services**:
   Since fiber optic customers have the highest churn despite using superior technology, investigate service quality, pricing, and customer service issues specific to these customers. Improved communication and support may help retain them.

4. **Focus on Administrative Efficiency**:
   The higher volume of administrative tickets indicates potential issues with billing, contracts, or account management. Streamlining these processes and improving the customer experience in this area may reduce churn.

5. **Retention Programs for Customers Without Dependents**:
   Since individuals without dependents are more likely to churn, tailor specific retention programs (e.g., personalized offers, product bundles) targeting single individuals or smaller households.

By implementing these strategies, the company can address key drivers of churn and improve both customer retention and overall financial performance.
